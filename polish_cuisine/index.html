	<p>Polish cuisine is a style of cooking and food preparation originating in or widely popular in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland">Poland</a>. Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Poland">history</a>. Polish cuisine shares many similarities with other Slavic countries, especially <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_cuisine">Czech</a>, <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_cuisine>Slovak</a>, and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_cuisine">Ukrainian</a> cuisines. It has also been widely influenced by other Central European cuisines, namely <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cuisine">German</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_cuisine">Austrian</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_cuisine">Hungarian</a> cuisines as well as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_cuisine">Jewish</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine">French</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine">Turkish</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine">Italian</a> culinary traditions. It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region), winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish <i lang="pl">bigos</i>), and herbs. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are <i lang="pl">kluski</i> as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word <i lang="pl">kasza</i>). Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas eve dinner (<a href = 
		"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigilia"><i lang="pl">Wigilia</i></a>) or Easter breakfast which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety.</p>

	<p>The Polish national dishes are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigos"><i lang="pl">bigos</i></a>; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi"><i lang="pl">pierogi</i></a>; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielbasa"><i lang="pl">kiełbasa</i></a>; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlet_schabowy"><i lang="pl">kotlet schabowy</i></a> (type of breaded cutlet); <a  href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gołąbki"><i lang="pl">gołąbki</i></a> (type of cabbage roll); <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zrazy"><i lang="pl">zrazy</i></a> (type of roulade); roast (<i lang="pl">pieczeń</i>); sour cucumber soup (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_soup"><i lang="pl">zupa ogórkowa</i></a>); mushroom soup, (<i lang="pl">zupa grzybowa</i> - quite different from the North American cream of mushroom); tomato soup (<i lang="pl">zupa pomidorowa</i>); <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosół"><i lang="pl">rosół</i></a> (variety of meat broth); <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_rye_soup"><i lang="pl">żurek</i></a> (sour rye soup); <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripe_soups#Poland"><i lang="pl">flaki</i></a> (variety of tripe soup); and <i lang="pl">barszcz</i> among others.</p>

	<p>The main meal might be eaten about 2 p.m. or later. It is larger than the North American lunch. It might be composed of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular <i lang="pl">rosół</i> and tomato soup or more festive <i lang="pl">barszcz</i> (beet borscht) or <i lang="pl">żurek</i> (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or <i lang="pl">kotlet schabowy</i> (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as <i lang="pl">surówka</i> – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (<i lang="pl">kapusta kiszona</i>). The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals). Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or <i lang="pl">drożdżówka</i>, a type of yeast cake. Other Polish specialities include <i lang="pl">chłodnik</i> (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), <i lang="pl">golonka</i> (pork knuckles cooked with vegetables), <i lang="pl">kołduny</i> (meat dumplings), <i lang="pl">zrazy</i> (stuffed slices of beef), <i lang="pl">salceson</i> and <i lang="pl">flaki</i> (tripe).</p>
